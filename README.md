This is a Java web-based application that serves as a CRM tool that allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete customer in the database.
Spring MVC and Hibernate are used to build the application and interact with the database.
The application and the database are deployed to Amazon Cloud using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon RDS.
